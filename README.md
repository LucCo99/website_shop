## Welcome
Welcome to the ParkLogic Jul/2024 Hackathon!

We hope you enjoy the next week coding with us as we tackle this challenge together.

This repository will be used to share documentation and code developed during the hackathon.
Feel free to use the repository features such as Issues and Projects to help managing your tasks.

Please do not commit code directly into the `main` branch or into a branch created by another participant.
If you would like to contribute code into someone else's branch, please open a pull request.

## What will you need
You will need a laptop to work on (please let us know if you need to borrow one, we have a couple of spares).

We will be coding in PHP 8.0 and using MySQL as the primary database.

Feel free to use whatever development environment you prefer.
We use the JetBrains IDE suite in-house. If you already have experience with it, or with to give it a go, free-trials are available for 30 days:
https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/

We will have a testing environment where we will run the completed code, and we can also provide a staging environment where you can test your code as you go if you don't want to run it on your local machine. 

## House rules
Please be respectful and take care not to damage the property.

Smoking or vaping is not allowed inside the property.
